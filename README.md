# Hi!

I like to make things in [Go](https://golang.org).

# Favourite languages
 
 - Go
 - Scala
 - Rust
 - Kotlin
 - Java (Nostalgia reasons)
 - Lua (Same as Java)
 - Haskell (I'm terrible at using it, but it's so cool)
 - C (Until I have to link libraries in)

# Languages that I can make things in but are often painful to use

 - Javascript
 - Python (Mostly when using boto3 does it hurt)
 - Bash (I use it a lot. It's not pleasant)
