# Hi!

I like to make things in many languages, because it's fun.

# Languages I Like

If I have a project idea, I'll probably consider using one of these.

 - Scala ❤️
 - Go ❤️
 - Haskell
 - Rust
 - Kotlin
 - Java
 - Python
 - Lua
 - C
 - Typescript

# Languages I don't like

Sometimes, you have to use one of these. 
Even if it's going to be a bit painful.

 - Javascript 💩
 - Bash
